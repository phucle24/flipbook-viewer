# PDF Import Testing Walkthrough

This document provides a step-by-step guide for testing the PDF import feature of the flipbook application.

## The Issue

The original PDF import feature was using `pdf-parse` which relies on Node.js `Buffer` objects that aren't available in the browser environment. This caused PDF import to fail when using the application in a browser context.

## The Solution

We've replaced the PDF parsing logic with PDF.js, which is designed to work in browser environments. This library can parse PDF documents directly from ArrayBuffers without requiring Node.js Buffer objects.

## Testing Steps

1. Navigate to the admin dashboard
2. Go to the PDF Import page
3. Generate a test PDF using the "Create Sample PDF for Testing" button
4. Upload the downloaded PDF
5. Click the "Preview" button to see the extracted content
6. Click "Import PDF" to proceed
7. Verify that the PDF content has been properly extracted
8. Continue to the story editor
9. Publish the story
10. View the published story as a user to confirm everything works

## Expected Results

- The PDF should be successfully uploaded and parsed
- The text content should be extracted from all pages
- Images should be assigned to each page
- The imported content should be available for editing in the story editor
- The final published story should display correctly with all content

## Potential Issues

- If PDF.js cannot process a PDF, an error message will be displayed
- Very large PDFs may still cause performance issues
- Complex PDFs with special formatting may not extract perfectly (known limitation)
- PDF.js worker scripts need to load from CDN, so internet connection is required

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Try using a simpler PDF
3. Verify that the PDF.js worker is loading correctly from CDN
4. Ensure the PDF is not encrypted or password-protected
